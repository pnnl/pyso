    For the off-shore-wind use case, we only need three market states so
    those will be hard-coded as below. The way this market works, all of 
    the activity of the market takes place at the transisitions. I'm 
    (TDH) using the "transitions" library which allows the definition
    of callback functions when entering (and exiting) any given state
    and this is the primary method by which the activity will in the
    market will take place. 

    Documentation on the "transitions" library can be found here:
